# Neural Open Information Extraction

This repository stores codes that I use for *Open Relation Extraction*(The work I am doing in THUNLP).

## First stage

Try to reproduce the paper *Neural Open Information Extraction*. I have used OpenNMT and Transformers for it. The codes are stored in `OpenNMT-version` and `Transformers-version` folder.

## Second stage

Use BART to do open relation extraction. Using The dataset FewRel now.

## Third stage

Now trying T5 to enhance the model. Moreover, trying to use `prompt` and `beam search` to enhance the model.

The dataset is still FewRel.
